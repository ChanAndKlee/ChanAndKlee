Hi, I'm Chan - a junior student in the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) of Mahidol University. I aim to be a lifelong learning person as it brings me to a new interest concurrently with updating my existing knowledge. I am determined to use the knowledge to be the most beneficial to my daily tasks and society. I am wondered about how the data turn to be insights that helps the business. Therefore, I am interested in Data analysis and want to explore about how it works, as of this reason, I am currently learning in several courses related to the topic including "Google Data Analytics". ðŸ˜¼ Apart from the mentioned, I'm interested in interface design, as it helps me to become more attentive to detail and makes the content looks more pleasant to the users.
